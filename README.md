## Todo app

This project contains a simple TODO application
it has following features :

- Anyone can create a todo
- Anyone can see their existing todos
- Anyone can mark a todo as done

My Approach:

- created readme
- mkdir backend,
  express -> zod -> db -> routes
- npm create vite@latest -> created react app named frontend
- added components/createTodo,Todos for the page
- updated App.jsx such that it renders the state

Technologies used: 

**Frontend:**

- React
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5

**Backend:**

- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- Mongoose

**Other (if applicable):**

- Git
- GitHub
- Deployment platform (vercel, render)
